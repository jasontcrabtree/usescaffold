    <h2>Figma Copy and Paste Issues</h2>
    <p>
      There is sometimes consistency problems with copying and pasting the
      pre-built design prototypes. Luckily, there's an easy fix!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you copy and paste an element and find the connections (blue lines)
      disappear when you paste the new element simply change to the Prototype
      tab
      <strong>(Option/Alt + 9)</strong> and copy and paste the element again.
