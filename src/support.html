    <h2>Figma Copy and Paste Issues</h2>
    <p>
      There is sometimes consistency problems with copying and pasting the
      pre-built design prototypes. Luckily, there's an easy fix!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you copy and paste a design and the prototype connections (blue lines)
      disappear when you paste the copied design change to the Prototype tab
      <kbd>Option</kbd>
      /
      <kbd>Alt</kbd>
      +
      <kbd>9</kbd>
      and copy and paste the element again.
