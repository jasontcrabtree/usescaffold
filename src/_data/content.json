Because of that, you'll get the best results using Scaffold in Figma. If you're interested in a future version using another tool please contact me."

      "faqsListItems3": "Not at this stage (April 2020). Figma Components don't reliably save prototyping connections on duplication or re-use. Scaffold relies on copy and pasting, which has consistent behavior across files, pages and within pages. I would love to rebuild Scaffold using Components in the future, so watch this space based on changes to Figma!"
