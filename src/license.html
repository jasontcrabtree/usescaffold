        <h2>Lifetime License Details</h2>
        <p>
            The Scaffold Library is sold as 1.0 of a lifetime license. By buying Scaffold, you get lifetime access and downloads to Scaffold 1.0, plus any updates between April 2020 and Dec 2020. Future releases, if any, will be released under a new version number.
        </p>

        <p>
            This license structure is similar to
            <a href="https://www.sketch.com/pricing/">Sketch</a>
            and
            <a href="https://useflowkit.com/license">Flowkit</a>
            , two other software downloads released under similar licenses.

            Multiple and Team Licenses
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you need multiple licenses for your team, you'll need to buy a team license. If you would like more than five licenses, please send an email to
            <a href="mailto:jasontcrabtree@gmail.com">jasontcrabtree@gmail.com.</a>

        <h2>Legal License: (EULA)</h2>
        <p>
            The End-User License Agreement (EULA) is a legal document that protects me, and you. Read the
            <a href="/eula">End-User License Agreement (EULA).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level summary is that you can use the Scaffold Library to design new work, including commercial work, but you can't reproduce, copy resell or redistribute the core Scaffold library itself. Please use Scaffold for your own work, not to take mine!
